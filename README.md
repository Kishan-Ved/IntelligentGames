# Intelligent Game Engine
Intelligent games in C/C++, along with a cubesolver. All the code has been written in C/C++ from scratch, without using any libraries.

Rules for the Game of Sim and Connect4 are available on wikipedia. I've included the working of the cubesolver here, the other games have sufficient instructions at the start to make them understandable. I've also included a description of up-it-up game by CCL, IITGN.

# CubeSolver
## Solves any 2X2X2 Rubik's cube 
This repository contains code to solve any 2X2X2 Rubik's cube. 

The file cube.c contains the C language code to solve any cube (or return an illegal state). 

Refer to cube_img to understand the permutations and orientations, also use 2by2by2 pdf for reference. 

## Description of Moves:

R represents a clockwise turn of the right face of the cube.

U represents a clockwise turn of the up (top) face of the cube.

F represents a clockwise turn of the front face of the cube.

R', U', F' represent an anti-clockwise turn of the right, up, and front faces of the cube resp.

R2, U2, F2 represent a 180Â° turn of the right, up, and front faces of the cube resp.

## Data Structures Used:

This project uses only:
1. Arrays
2. Queues (implented as arrays)
3. Graphs

## Algorithm Used:

BFS - Breadth First Search is used to find the shortest path to the solve the cube.

# Up it up

The classic puzzle always starts at the same position. For our question, the cubes may start in any configuration on the board given as input (choose a reasonable input format). Your program should print a shortest sequence of moves that will solve it (The final configuration is same as in the classic game in the demo), or print that no solution exists if it is unsolvable.

No inbuilt libraries have been used, all code is written from scratch.
